# Fullstack Event ListApp

---

## Overview

_Fullstack Event ListApp_ is an application thanks to which you can check registered events and add
new events to registered events base by yourself. The application consists of two sides: backend and frontend one.
Registered events are saved to database.
Using the app you are going to get to know with events data and information about authors (first name, last name and email address).
You can also register new events by yourself using registration form.

Backend side is created with **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Modular Monolith Architecture** (currently single module - ready to expand by further modules).
The app is covered with **tests** both on backend and frontend.
**Data validation** takes place both on browser and server side.
**Error handling** is implemented too.
The application is coded with use of TypeScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jest - with use of good practice of clean code.
Code formatted with use of Prettier.
